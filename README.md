# Crop Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

## Overview

The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based solution designed to assist farmers and agricultural stakeholders in determining the most suitable crop to cultivate based on various environmental and soil parameters. This system leverages machine learning models to analyze input data such as soil nutrients, weather conditions, and rainfall, providing accurate crop recommendations.

## Features

Predicts the best crop to cultivate based on input parameters.

Utilizes environmental and soil data for decision-making.

User-friendly input system for easy data entry.

High accuracy with pre-trained machine learning models.

## Input Parameters

The system requires the following input parameters for making predictions:

N: Nitrogen content in the soil (kg/ha).

P: Phosphorus content in the soil (kg/ha).

K: Potassium content in the soil (kg/ha).

Temperature: Atmospheric temperature (Â°C).

Humidity: Relative humidity (%).

pH: pH value of the soil.

Rainfall: Annual rainfall (mm).

## How It Works

- User inputs the required parameters into the system.

- The input data is processed and passed to a pre-trained machine learning model.

- The model predicts the most suitable crop for the given conditions.

- The predicted crop name is displayed to the user.

## Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

## Libraries:

pandas for data manipulation.

numpy for numerical computations.

scikit-learn for building and deploying machine learning models.

Machine Learning Model: Pre-trained classification model.


Enter the input parameters as prompted.

View the recommended crop based on the input data.

# Example

### Input:

Enter value for N (Nitrogen): 90
Enter value for P (Phosphorous): 40
Enter value for K (Potassium): 30
Enter value for temperature: 25
Enter value for humidity: 70
Enter value for pH: 6.5
Enter value for rainfall: 100

### Output:

The predicted class for the input data is: Rice
